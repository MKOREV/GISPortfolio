    <h2>Thesis: Geodiversity in Texel</h2>
    <p>Currently, there is no standardized method for mapping geodiversity. Several mapping methods have been proposed to quantify and assess geodiversity. The four principal components (geology, geomorphology, lithology, and hydrology) of geodiversity have not been represented into a single digital map. Existing geodiversity assessment methods use the separated components or grid-based index maps. Both approaches ignore the spatial distribution of scale-dependent geofeatures. Therefore, this research aims to standardize, test, and apply geodiversity mapping by utilizing a hierarchical taxonomy that allows for conveying geodiversity information at varying scales. The study area is the island of Texel in the Netherlands, known for high geodiversity gradients compared to its size . For this method, a semi-automated workflow is created that combines existing geodiversity components in a single digital geodiversity map. The result is a multi-scale hierarchical geodiversity map developed for Texel and tested in two specific research areas. The geodiversity map clearly shows the different geodiversity components in a single map layer and is able to dynamically display the different taxonomic level of all components and its features. The results indicate that landscapes mainly developed by both erosion and deposition process have higher geomorphological, geological and soil diversity. The workflow can be employed by earth and environmental scientists to develop uniformal hierarchical geodiversity maps in various  environments. </p>
